 Dr Rohitash Chandra  leads a program of research encircling methodologies and applications of artificial intelligence. The methodologies include  Bayesian deep learning, neuroevolution,  ensemble learning, and data augmentation. The applications include climate extremes, geoscientific models, mineral exploration, biomedicine, and  COVID-19 where the focus has been drug selection, infection forecasting, and social media-based language modelling.  Dr Chandra has also pioneered the area of language models for studying ancient religious-philosophical texts.   Dr Chandra used machine learning and remote sensing for mineral exploration and is currently focusing on critical metals. He has been using machine learning for climate extremes and currently developing a model for decadal forecasts of high-category cyclones.
